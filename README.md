# astrophysics-intensity-maps
Here, I make velocity integrated intensity maps of three galactic sources using python. 

# Code and resources
Python version: 3.9.9
Packages: aplpy, matplotlib
# Model Building

I have used fits images (CII emission) of three sources toplot their velocity inegrated intensity maps. 
 
# Note
I am not adding the fits files because of their large sizes but the python scripts are attached.  
# Image
